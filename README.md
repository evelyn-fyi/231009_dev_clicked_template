The template repository for the data for the 10/09/2023 Developer Sprint for Clicked.

## Intro

This three-week Team Sprint will give aspiring Salesforce professionals the skills they need to be more comfortable as a Salesforce Developer. You will gain a base level understanding of a Business Analyst’s tasks of refining user stories and identifying business case definitions to scope a solution to meet a client’s business needs. You’ll then apply that base level understanding while you go through a list of tasks as a Developer in a Salesforce instance. These tasks will be specifically tailored to the Salesforce Developer role to assist you in passing the exam, and more importantly, give you hands-on practice into the setup, API Calls, visualforce pages and other out of the box features native to Salesforce.

Along the way, you’ll be supported by coaches, peers, and the Clicked community to develop your skills, gain valuable experience, and finish with a project output that can be shared as part of your professional portfolio.
